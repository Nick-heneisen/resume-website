      <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of this website is to showcase my abilities as a computer programmer and showcase projects that I have worked on.

        <p>
          My name is Nick Heneisen, and I'm an Indiana University graduate with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science.
          I majored in Computer Science with a specialization in Software Engineering, and minored in Game Design.
          <br />
          <br />
          I've been in love with computers since I was a little kid. I've been blessed with knowing that was what I wanted to do
          with my life since then.
