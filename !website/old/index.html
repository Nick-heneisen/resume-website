      <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of this website is to kickstart my career in computer
          science early on. Creating a portfolio and being able to demonstrate
           my capabilities in programming is important in securing a job in
           today's competitive landscape.

        <p>
          My name is Nick Heneisen, and I'm a Computer Science major and Game
          Design minor from Indianapolis, Indiana. My biggest career goal is to
          become a video game programmer, either on my own or for another
          company, but I've known since I was in elementary school that
          that was what I wanted to do.
